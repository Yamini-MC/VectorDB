Cybersecurity Fundamentals

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. 
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Types of Cyber Threats:
1. Malware: Malicious software including viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware.
2. Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources.
3. Man-in-the-Middle Attack: Attacks where the attacker secretly intercepts communication.
4. Denial-of-Service Attack: Flooding systems or networks to exhaust resources and make them unavailable.

Best Practices:
- Use strong and unique passwords.
- Enable multi-factor authentication.
- Keep software and systems up to date.
- Regularly back up data.
- Educate employees about cybersecurity awareness.

Cybersecurity is not a one-time effort but an ongoing process to stay ahead of evolving threats.
